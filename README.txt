Welcome to SuImT.net
You know normal social media? Facebook is for boomers, LinkedIn for people looking for jobs. Instagram is either for teenage girls or for dark humor loving nazis. 4Chan is known for its nonexisting rules. And "ShutupImTalking.net"? Simple: No rules, no seriousness, 
no smart people or smart things. Just vibes. If theres something to say? Say it. We may or may not listening. Have fun. And before you go, i want to warn you: Nothing you hear here is 100% real. Its guaranteed to find fake news. So if some dude tells you that angela merkel died, 
it might not be real.
